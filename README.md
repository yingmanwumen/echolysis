Echolysis (`Echo` + `-lysis`) is an open-source duplicate code detection tool that aims to provide fast and accurate code duplication analysis across multiple programming languages.

## Why Echolysis?

While commercial IDEs like JetBrains products offer excellent duplicate code detection features, there's a gap in the open-source ecosystem. Existing open-source solutions often:

- Support only a limited set of programming languages
- Lack integration with modern development environments
- Have performance limitations with large codebases

Echolysis addresses these challenges by:

- Leveraging tree-sitter for robust and fast parsing across many languages
- Providing both CLI and Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementations (IN PROGRESS)
- Enabling easy integration with various editors and IDEs with the help of LSP (IN PROGRESS)
- Offering a language-agnostic approach that makes adding new language support straightforward (Currently only Rust and Python are supported)

## Features

- Fast and accurate duplicate code detection
- Support for multiple programming languages through tree-sitter (IN PROGRESS)
- CLI tool for command-line usage and CI/CD integration (IN PROGRESS)
- LSP server for real-time duplicate detection in editors
- Easy to extend with new language support

## Current Status

Echolysis currently supports:
- Rust
- Python

More languages will be added in the future.

## Components

- `echolysis-core`: Core duplicate detection engine
- `echolysis-cli`: Command line interface
- `echolysis-lsp`: Language Server Protocol implementation
